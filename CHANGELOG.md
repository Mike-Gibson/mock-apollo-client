# [1.0.0](https://github.com/Mike-Gibson/mock-apollo-client/releases/tag/v1.0.0) (2020-08-20)

### Features

* **[Breaking Change]** Support `@apollo/client` v3 (drops support for `apollo-client` v2) [#16](https://github.com/Mike-Gibson/mock-apollo-client/pull/16)

  If targeting Apollo Client 2, continue using the latest 0.x version.

  Apollo Client 3 no longer passes `@client` directives down to links, so `mock-apollo-client` can no longer support queries which consist entirely of `@client` directives. `mock-apollo-client` will log a warning if a query handler is registered for a query which only contains `@client` directives.

### Documentation

* Updated Readme to reflect update to Apollo Client 3
* Updated Readme examples to use hooks
